This is only an alpha version of the script. There may be bugs, also, if this repository grows to a large scale, I will completely rewrite the code and call other people. But you can already help by writing me in Telegram. And yes, this script is not of the best quality, but I'm trying to make things easier with my knowledge. Thank you.
